   <b id="introduction"> Introduction:</b> <br><br>

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter <br>
 message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller <br>
 on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing. Thanks to its simple and accessible user experience, Arduino <br>
 has been used in thousands of different projects and applications. The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. <br>
 Teachers and students use it to build low-cost scientific instruments, to prove chemistry and physics principles, or to get started with programming and robotics. <br>

<b id="Day-1">	DAY-1</b><br><br>

<h4> On day-1 </h4><br><br>
 I learned about Orientation session Introduction to Embedded system Overview on Arduino & other microcontroller Application of Arduino & interview questions <br>
  A microcontroller does not know what to do by itself. It’s your job to tell it what you want it to do. Write program code on your computer Compile the code <br>
   with a compiler for the microcontroller you are using
Upload the compiled version of your program to your microcontroller Arduino Ide is used to write compile and upload code to the board. A lay man can easily write <br>
code for Arduino in Arduino IDE. It’s very simple and easy to understand. In Arduino flash we can upload code by just connecting the board USB port without computer/laptop <br>
and pressing the upload button in Arduino IDE. We do not need an external programmer. Arduino board has programmer built on it. <br>

<b id="Day-2"> DAY-2</b><br><br>
<h4> On day-2</h4><br><br>
 I learned about 
How to Install Arduino IDE Exploring Arduino IDE <br>
Programming Arduino Basic syntax
The Arduino Integrated Development Environment is a cross-platform application that is written in functions from C and C++. <br>
It is used to write and upload programs to Arduino compatible boards, but also, with the help of third-party cores, other vendor development boards. <br>

<b id="Day-3"> DAY-3</b><br><br>

 		<h4> On day-3</h4><br>
 I learned about 
Concepts about sensor & digital <br>
basic embedded application using Arduino 
LED is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current is passed through it. Light is produced when the particles <br>
that carry the current (known as electrons and holes) combine together within the semiconductor material. Switch is an electrical component that can disconnect or connect <br>
 the conducting path in an electrical circuit, interrupting the electric current or diverting it from one conductor to another. <br>

<b id="Day-4"> DAY-4</b><br><br>

		 <h4> On day-4</h4><br><br> 
I learned about 
Analog I/O Laser
Rat trap design using Analog input <br>
A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. <br>
aser, a device that stimulates atoms or molecules to emit light at particular wavelengths and amplifies that light, typically producing a very narrow beam of radiation. <br>
 A photoresistor or light dependent resistor is an electronic component that is sensitive to light. When light falls upon it, then the resistance changes.
  Values of the resistance of the LDR may change over many orders of magnitude the value of the resistance falling as the level of light increases. <br>

  <h4>On day-5 </h4><br><br>
I learned about 
UART Protocol & Serial Communication <br>
Bluetooth Control Application 
A UART’s main purpose is to transmit and receive serial data In UART communication, two UARTs communicate directly with each other. <br>
 The transmitting UART converts parallel data from a controlling device like a CPU into serial form, transmits it in serial to the receiving UART, <br>
 which then converts the serial data back into parallel data for the receiving device Serial Bluetooth module for Arduino and other microcontrollers Operating Voltage: <br>
  4V to 6V (Typically +5V) Operating Current: 30mA Range: 100m Works with Serial communication (USART) and TTL compatible Follows IEEE 802.15.1 standardized protocol Uses Frequency-Hopping <br>
   Spread spectrum (FHSS) Can operate in Master, Slave or Master/Slave mode Can be easily interfaced with Laptop or Mobile phones with Bluetooth Supported baud rate: 9600,19200,38400,57600,115200,230400,460800 <br>
